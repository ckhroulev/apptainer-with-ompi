Bootstrap: docker
From: centos:centos7
# CentOS 7 uses glibc old enough (2.17) to work with older kernels
# (for example 2.6.32 in CentOS 6.10 on Chinook).

    # ibutils, perftest, and qperf are recommended as well. They are

    # Open MPI 4.x uses UCX to support InfiniBand devices.
    #
    # One could avoid installing UCX by setting the MCA parameter
    # btl_openib_allow_ib.

    # This was recommended by UAF RCS, along with libevent and hwloc.
    # However, libevent and hwloc versions bundled with recent
    # versions of Open MPI are newer than ones in CentOS 7.
    # yum -y install \
    #    ucx \
    #    ucx-devel \
